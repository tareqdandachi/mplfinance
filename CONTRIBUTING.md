- Contributing can as simple as **asking questions**, participating in discussions, suggesting enhancements, etc.  **All of these are valuable!**  There are many ways to contribute.

- All of the usual/typical open source contribution guidelines apply (see for example, **[Matplotlib Contributing](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/devel/contributing.html)** and **[Open Source Guide to Contributing](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)**).  Therefore, here, on this page, we will mention just a few items that we may be particular about in **mplfinance**.


- Coding:
  - If you write code, please don't use tabs; rather use spaces.
  - If you add a significant feature --that is, a feature for which explaining its usage takes more than just a few sentences-- please also create a "tutorial notebook" for that feature.  **[For examples of tutorial notebooks, please see the jupyter notebooks in the examples folder.](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance/tree/master/examples)**
  - If you add a significant feature, please also create a regression test file **[in the tests folder](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance/tree/master/tests)**, similar to the other regression tests that are there.  *Often, the simplest way to do this is to take a few of the examples from the feature's "tutorial notebook"* (see previous point).
